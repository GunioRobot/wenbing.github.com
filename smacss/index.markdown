### __一份给大小网站的 CSS 架构进化指南。__

I've long lost count of how many web sites I've built. You'd think after having built a few hundred of them I'd have discovered the "one true way" of doing it. I don't think there is one true way. What I *have* discovered are techniques that can keep CSS more organized and more structured, leading to code that is easier to build and easier to maintain.

I've been analyzing my process (and the process of those around me) and figuring out how best to structure my code for projects on a larger scale. The concepts were vaguely there with the smaller sites that I had worked on but have become more concrete as a result of working on more complex projects. Small sites don't often hit the same pain points as a larger site; small sites aren't as complex and don't change as often. However, what I intend to describe in these pages is an approach that can work equally well for sites small and large.

SMACSS (pronounced "smacks") is more style guide than rigid framework. There's no library within here for you to download or install. SMACSS is a way to examine your design process and as a way to fit those rigid frameworks into a flexible thought process. It's an attempt to document a consistent approach to site development when using CSS. And really, who isn't building a site with CSS these days?! Feel free to take this in its entirety or use only the parts that work best for you. Or don't use it at all. I understand that this won't be everybody's cup of tea. When it comes to web development, the answer to most questions is "it depends".

## 这里讲什么？

My thoughts have been compartmentalized around a number of topics related to CSS architecture. Each thought is detailed in its own section. Read the sections in sequence or out of order or pick and choose what seems most relevant to you. It's not 1000 pages of writing; the sections are relatively short and easy to digest.

I also intend for this to be a discussion. I would like to continue to expand on what I have here with more content, more examples, and more articles that expand on the base concept. Provide your feedback and let's discuss a better way to approach CSS architecture.
