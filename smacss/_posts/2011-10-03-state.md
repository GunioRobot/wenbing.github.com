<h1>State Representation</h1>

<p>You've got a Photoshop document open in front of you and you've been told to turn it into the magic that is HTML and CSS (with maybe a little JavaScript thrown in for good measure). </p>

<p>It may seem straight forward to start mapping things directly from the composition to the code. However, various components on your page are likely to need to be represented in various states. There's the default state that something should appear in and then what it should look like when the state changes.</p>

<h2>What's a state change?</h2>

<p>State changes are represented in one of three ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>class name</li>
  <li>pseudo-class</li>
  <li>media query</li>
</ol>

<p>A <b>class name</b> change happens with JavaScript. Via some interaction, be it moving the mouse around, hitting something on the keyboard, or some other event occurring. An element gets a new class applied and then the visual appearance changes.</p>

<p>A <b>pseudo-class</b> change is done via any number of pseudo-classes, and there are a lot. In these cases, we no longer have to rely on JavaScript to describe the state change. Pseudo-classes are still limited in that we can only style changes to elements that are descendents or siblings of the element in which the pseudo-class applies. Otherwise, we're back to using JavaScript.</p>

<p>Lastly, <b>media queries</b> describe how things should by styled under defined criteria, such as different viewport sizes.</p>

<h2>What's the point?</h2>
<p>With a module-based system, it is important to consider state-based design as applied to each of the modules. When you actively ask yourself, "what is the default state," then you'll find yourself thinking proactively about progressive enhancement. It also can have you approaching issues slightly differently.</p>



<h3>CSS Animations</h3>
<p>Animations are an interesting beast and some may argue that it is defining behaviour in a layer where it shouldn't be defined. CSS is for styling, after all. JavaScript is for behaviour.</p>
<p>The distinction here is to understand that CSS defines a visual "state". We can use JavaScript to switch the state of an element on our page. JavaScript should not be used to describe the state, though. That is, it shouldn't be used to add inline styles. </p>

<p>Historically, we've used JavaScript to create animation because it was the only way we had available to do so (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-HTMLplusTIME">HTML+TIME</a> notwithstanding).</p>

<p>When we think of things in these terms, it can help shape how we approach various situations. For example, it wouldn't be unusual to have a message appear on the page for a short period of time and then fade out.</p>

<div class="exm exm-code">
<p class="exm-caption">JavaScript handling state change</p>
<pre><code>
function showMessage (s) {
    var el = document.getElementById('message');
    el.innerHTML = s;

    /* set state */
    el.className = 's-visible'; 
    setTimeout(function(){
        /* set state back */
        el.className = 's-hidden';
    }, 3000);
}
</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>The message state changes from hidden to visible and back to hidden again. The JavaScript handles the changes in these states and then CSS can be used to animate between these—using either CSS transitions or animations.</p>


  <div class="exm exm-code">
  <p class="exm-caption">CSS handling the transition</p>
<pre><code>
@keyframes fade {
    0% { opacity:0; display:block; }
  100% { opacity:1; display:block; }
}

.s-visible {
    display: block;
    animation: fade 2s;
}

.s-hidden {
    display: none;
    animation: fade 2s reverse;
}
</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>I admit, this last example wouldn't actually work. Unfortunately, the current animation specification and browser implementations won't allow for us to specify non-animatable properties in our animation. Thankfully, the spec is still changing and should have this added eventually—with browser implementations to follow. In the meantime, we need to do something like the following.</p>

    <div class="exm exm-code">
      <p class="exm-caption">Animations in current browsers</p>
<pre><code>
@-webkit-keyframes fade {
    0% { opacity:0;  }
  100% { opacity:1; display:block; }
}

.s-visible {
    opacity: 1;
    animation: fade 2s;
}

.s-hidden {
    opacity: 0;
    animation: fade 2s reverse;
}

.s-removed {
    display: none;
}

/* and then our javascript */
function showMessage (s) {
    var el = document.getElementById('message');
    el.innerHTML = s;

    /* set state */
    el.className = 's-visible'; 
    setTimeout(function(){
        /* set state back */
        el.className = 's-hidden';
        setTimeout(function(){
            el.className = 's-removed';
        }, 2000);
    }, 3000);
}
</code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>In this case, I've changed it to still do the animation but then to use JavaScript to remove the element from flow after the animation should be done. </p>

      <p>In this way, we maintain the separation between style (aka state) and behaviour.</p>
